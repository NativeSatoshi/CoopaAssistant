> **"Bridging the gap between AI Intelligence and Data Permanence."**

CoopaAssistant is a sovereign digital assistant that provides users with an encrypted, eternal vault on the **Arweave Permaweb**. By utilizing **Polygon Mainnet** for secure identity and **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** for multimodal analysis, CoopaAssistant ensures your memories and data are not just stored, but are searchable and accessible for generations.

## 🌟 Key Innovations
- **Semantic Search:** Don't search by filenames. Ask Gemini: *"Find the invoice from my trip to Paris"* or *"Show me the contract I signed last month."*
- **User-Centric Encryption:** Files are encrypted locally using your unique wallet signature. We never see your data; only you hold the keys.
- **Perpetual Storage:** Leveraging Arweave via the **Turbo SDK**, data is stored forever with a one-time fee—no monthly subscriptions.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro & `text-embedding-004`.
- **Blockchain Identity:** MetaMask (EVM Wallet Signatures) on Polygon.
- **Permanent Layer:** Arweave (via Turbo SDK).
- **Backend/Frontend:** Node.js, Express, HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Infrastructure:** Hosted on Render with a custom domain.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap
- [x] **Q1 2026:** Mainnet Launch & Gemini Integration (Current Status).
- [ ] **Q2 2026:** Mobile Application (React Native) for seamless vault access.
- [ ] **Q3 2026:** Decentralized Encrypted Sharing (Peer-to-Peer data exchange).
